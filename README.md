# NumberMatrixV2

Welcome to the [Number Matrix V2](https://hackaday.io/project/189394-number-matrix-v2) repository. This `README` will provide an 
introduction to the project.

## About the Number Matrix V2
The V2 Number Matrix is the sequel to the [V1 Number Matrix](https://hackaday.io/project/179915-number-matrix). The V1 matrix was controlled using a Raspberry Pi Pico.  The software was written using the Arduino IDE and an OpenGL based emulator running on windows.

This repository will be used to allow for some level of collaboration for those interested in creating applications that will run on the matrix.  This will include the simulation application and any currently available demos.

## Usage
Describe how an application is created.

## Installing the simulator environment
The simulator was developed using CodeBlocksIDE using the MinGW compiler and FreeGLUT running on Windows 10.  The application will also compile on a Raspberry Pi using the appropriately linked OpenGL library.

## Usage on Windows.
Put installation instructions here.

## Usage on Raspberry PI
Maybe put words here.

## Usage in Linux
